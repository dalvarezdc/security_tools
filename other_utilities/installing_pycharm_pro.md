### Creating a Desktop Launcher for PyCharm

**Prerequisites:**  
- PyCharm is installed in a directory referred to as `{pycharm_installation_home}`.  
- You have an icon file available for PyCharm, for example `{pycharm_installation_home}/bin/pycharm.png`.  
- You know the path to the PyCharm launch script, typically `{pycharm_installation_home}/bin/pycharm.sh`.

**Example Directory Structure:**  
```
{pycharm_installation_home}/
   bin/
      pycharm.sh
      pycharm.png
```

---

### Steps

1. **Identify Installation Paths**  
   - **Launch Script:** `{pycharm_installation_home}/bin/pycharm.sh`  
   - **Icon File:** `{pycharm_installation_home}/bin/pycharm.png` or another preferred icon.

2. **Create a Desktop Entry Directory**  
   Ensure the directory `~/.local/share/applications` exists, creating it if necessary:  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
   ```

3. **Create the `.desktop` File**  
   Use a text editor to create a new file at `~/.local/share/applications/pycharm.desktop`:  
   ```bash
   nano ~/.local/share/applications/pycharm.desktop
   ```
   
   Paste the following, adjusting paths as needed:
   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=PyCharm
   Comment=The Python IDE for Professional Developers
   Exec={pycharm_installation_home}/bin/pycharm.sh
   Icon={pycharm_installation_home}/bin/pycharm.png
   Terminal=false
   Type=Application
   Categories=Development;IDE;
   ```
   
   *Fields:*
   - **Name:** The label shown in your app menu.
   - **Comment:** A short description.
   - **Exec:** Path to the PyCharm launch script.
   - **Icon:** Path to the PyCharm icon.
   - **Terminal:** `false` for GUI applications.
   - **Type:** Must be `Application`.
   - **Categories:** Helps the system categorize the app.

4. **Save and Exit**  
   After editing, save the file and close your text editor.

5. **Set the Launcher as Executable**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/pycharm.desktop
   ```

6. **Update the Desktop Database (if required)**  
   Some systems may need to update the application database:
   ```bash
   update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
   ```

7. **Accessing Your New Launcher**  
   After these steps, open your system’s application menu and search for “PyCharm.” The new launcher should now appear. If it doesn’t show immediately, try logging out and back in, or re-run the `update-desktop-database` command.
