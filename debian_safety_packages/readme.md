# Linux Package Installer Script

This Bash script facilitates the installation of three commonly used security-related packages on Linux systems:

1. `ufw` - Uncomplicated Firewall
2. `fail2ban` - Ban IPs that make too many password failures
3. `apparmor` - Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system

## Prerequisites

- A Debian-based Linux distribution (like Ubuntu).
- `sudo` privileges to install packages.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the `install_packages.sh` script downloaded on your system.

2. Provide execution permission to the script:
```bash
chmod +x install_packages.sh
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
./install_packages.sh
```

4. You will be prompted individually for each of the three packages. You can choose to install or skip any of them.

## Script Workflow

Upon execution, the script will:

- Prompt you for the installation of each package.
- If you agree (`yes` or `y`), it will update the package repository and then install the chosen package.
- If you disagree (`no` or `n`), it will skip the installation of the package.
- If an invalid response is provided, the script will skip the installation for that specific package.

## Safety Note

Always be cautious when running scripts, especially those that require elevated privileges (`sudo`). Ensure you understand the actions the script will perform before executing it.

You can save the above content to a file named `README.md` in the same directory as your `install_packages.sh` script. If you host the directory on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, the `README.md` will be automatically rendered and displayed, providing users with detailed information about the script.
